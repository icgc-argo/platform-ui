            <b>What is Aggregate Information?</b> <br />
            "Aggregate information" is standard web server/visitor traffic information, commonly
            referred to as 'aggregate information', regarding overall website traffic patterns. We
            do not report on individual user sessions. Web servers normally collect this type of
            basic information as part of their web log processes. This aggregate information does
            not identify you and thus does not constitute personal information.
            <br />
            <br />
            In addition to information provided by our visitors we use the normal Internet tracking
            tools associated with standard Internet protocols and web-based systems. This system
            information is typically stored in log files and the information is used for aggregate
            reporting. Aggregate reporting includes total number of visitors, most visited sections,
            peak traffic times, etc. Log files are simply transaction records web servers maintain.
            Those logs are used for recording information, such as: Service provider IP addresses;
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>Browser versions;</li>
              <li>Referring websites;</li>
              <li>Search terms used;</li>
              <li>Average number of pages requested;</li>
              <li>Average duration of visit;</li>
              <li>Total visitor traffic.</li>

            We use aggregate information gathered from your visit to better design our Platform.
            This information supplies us with a broad picture of how people use our website in order
            to help the management of our systems and to better serve our stakeholders. How do we
            protect your Personal Information? We are committed to data security. In order to
            prevent unauthorized access, maintain the accuracy of your personal information and
            ensure that your personal information is used and disclosed only pursuant to this
            Policy, the OICR strives to maintain physical, electronic, contractual and
            administrative safeguards to secure your personal information we collect from the
            Platform with a level of security that is appropriate to the sensitivity of the personal
            information collected.
