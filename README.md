## Development

### Setup

- Install dependencies: `npm i`
- Set up environment: copy `.env.schema` to `.env` and update environment accordingly if needed. Out-of-the-box values are meant for local development.
- Dev commands:
  - `npm run dev-ui` for working on ui only
  - `npm run dev` for work that involves the custom server

### Writing commits

To keep commit messages consistent, we use [gitmoji-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gitmoji-cli), available as a dev dependency

- `npm run commit` will start interactive commit tool
- configuring gitmoji-cli: `npm run gitmoji-config`

`/uikit` contains the reusable UI components for Argo.

- ### Development:
  - `npm run storybook` to run start a local storybook.
  - creating a new component: `npm run create-component`
- ### Restriction:
  - `uikit` components should not reference (`import`) anything outside of the `uikit` directory
