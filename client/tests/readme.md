# E2E Testing

## Setup

## Running

## Creating Tests

## Guidelines

- Tests should test for one passing condition (keep it atomic)
- Use CSS selectors, preferably IDs.
  - prefer over xpath or difficult selectors for clean and concise tests
  - use IDs over variable selectors eg. nth-child(2) makes for a brittle test
