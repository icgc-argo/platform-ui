## Goals

- components should be self contained (source, test, story, documentation)
- components should have extensible styling
- components should have valid id and class names to allow targeting during testing
- components should meet a level of accessibilty

## Structure

Each component folder should have:

- source
- tests (for now some basic unit tests)
- a Storybook story
- a readme file documenting important points/decisions

## TODO

[ ] - easy export of individual components
